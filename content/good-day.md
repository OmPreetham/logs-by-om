THE BLUR. you believe.

Every time I used to wonder, "Am I a good person here?" Then I came to believe that no, this world isn't good. It's not about me, but the world echoes around you, urging you to be good to others while others are nitpicky about every random thing you do. "Be good" is a phrase that doesn't suit the man who just spoke. But the man who wants to be good isn't the same as the one who explores the world. It's better to be good for yesterday than for the present, and it's the future that holds everything, yet what your future self might hate is the future shaped by today's thoughts. I always think there are two types of weird noises floating around you: one you can hear in detail, the other just audible amidst the gossipers. This sound irritates others, but they don't realize the impact the world has on them. One might think it's downright bad, another might have a different perspective. But the truth is, everything is out of control. You yourself are the plaything of the person next to you, controlled by the social wizards around you. You are a good, bad boy from a world that has long passed.

Despite all this negativity you hear and think about, you are a good man, I know it, you are this good.

A person asked me, "How can the result you're showing be true when they fake it?" I replied, "Everything you see here is part of a fake narrative created to fit into. It's how we shape our perception to overcome the bad outcomes we anticipate. I can explain it better by saying, if a doctor asks about your mental health, you might sound good by saying, 'I'm good, not facing anything random.' But you are facing issues; you're just hiding them. Hiding is what we all do; even successful businesses hide their income and the less glamorous work they do. It's about being truthful to yourself. Be humble, be good, be with everyone. Believe in one, and that's you."
